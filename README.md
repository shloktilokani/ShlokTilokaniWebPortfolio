# Shlok Tilokani – Web Portfolio 🌐✨

A modern, lightweight, and fully responsive personal portfolio website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with a dynamic backend powered by **JSON**. Originally designed in **Python Flask**, the project was later migrated to a static JS-based architecture for simplicity, speed, and seamless hosting on cPanel.

## 🚀 Features

- 👨‍💼 **About Me, Projects, Experience, Certificates, and Contact sections**
- 🔄 **Dynamic Content** fetched from JSON files (for easy updates)
- 🎨 Clean and elegant UI (thanks to Mahimna for frontend support ❤️)
- 🧠 Developed over months with learnings in:
  - Web Hosting (cPanel)
  - GitHub Integration
  - Version Control with Cursor AI
- 🌍 One-click deployment workflow:  
  `Cursor AI → GitHub → cPanel` (via synced repo)
